look at the image, and return a json string with the following information: result, transaction time and transaction amount. If no receipt is found or you cannot analyze the image, result should have the value of fail. if receipt is found, result should have the value ok, transaction date should be in epoch time, transaction amount should be transaction amount. Only return a json string in all cases, and nothing else.
